* Introduction
* The code
** Dataset
** Layers
** The "Network" class
** Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training
** Validation
** Theano experience
** Hades setup
* Results
** Kullback-Leibler divergence between border and center
** First trainings: dense MLPs
** Failed experiment with convolutions
** Why I didn't experiment further with convolution/deconvolution
** Why I didn't use the captions
** GAN results
* Conclusion
** Kudos to other approaches
